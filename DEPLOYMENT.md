# 🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages

This guide will help you deploy your "From Bumble to Forever" website to GitHub Pages for **completely free hosting**.

## Birthday editions

The homepage is the current birthday chapter. A shared header provides the
year selector and an explicit return link from older birthdays. Selecting an
archive opens `<site-base>/?year=<year>`: a viewer that keeps the header visible
above an independent iframe containing the original edition. Its styles and
scripts stay isolated from the current design.

Frozen editions live in `client/public/<year>/`. Each contains its own HTML,
JavaScript, CSS, photographs, and an `edition.json` recording the exact source
commit and SHA-256 fingerprints of the built files. These folders are immutable:
never rebuild them during a normal deployment, edit their contents, or replace
them with imports from the current application. The original source remains
available in Git at the recorded commit. Keep that Git history.

Before replacing a year's homepage, commit its finished code and assets, then run:

```bash
npm run archive:birthday -- <year> <committed-revision>
npm run archive:verify
```

The archive command builds from that committed tree, not the working directory,
and refuses to overwrite an existing edition. It uses relative asset URLs and a
deployment-only routing base so that the original application works both locally
and under the GitHub Pages repository path. Previous archives are not nested
inside a new archive. Commit the generated folder alongside the new chapter.

Both production build commands verify the frozen files before building; GitHub
Pages automatically copies them unchanged from `client/public/`. A frozen
edition remains available at `<site-base>/<year>/` as the untouched standalone
page; normal year navigation uses the viewer instead. Register each archived
year in `client/src/lib/birthday-editions.ts`, with the newest archive first.
The current edition suppresses its own header when embedded, and cross-year
links target the top-level page, preventing duplicate headers or nested viewers
when it is archived in a later year.

For local development use `npm run dev`. The Vite configuration also serves the
standalone archive entry pages without passing them through the current router.
Use `npm run check`, `npm test`, and `npm run build:pages` before publishing.
The existing client-side passcode remains a courtesy gate, not private hosting.

## ⚠️ Important Note About Password Protection

The password protection ("pinky") is **client-side only**. On GitHub Pages (or any static hosting), anyone who views the source code can see and bypass the password. For true security, you would need server-side authentication, which isn't available on free static hosting.

**Options:**
- Keep it simple and deploy to GitHub Pages (password is just a courtesy gate)
- Use Netlify/Vercel with password protection features (may have costs)
- Keep on Replit with proper backend authentication

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (free)
- Git installed on your computer (or use GitHub Desktop)
- Your website code ready to push

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right → **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: Choose something like:
   - `sukheswari-birthday` 
   - `from-bumble-to-forever`
   - `sukheshwari-28`
4. Description: "A romantic birthday celebration website"
5. **Important:** Keep it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have code)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

#### Option A: Using Command Line (from Replit Shell)

```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your code
git commit -m "Initial commit: Birthday celebration website"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME and REPO-NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Option B: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Clone your empty repository
3. Copy all your project files into the cloned folder
4. Commit and push using the GUI

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **"Pages"**
4. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - Source: **"GitHub Actions"** (should be automatically selected)
5. That's it! GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your site

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow called "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running
3. Wait 2-5 minutes for the first deployment to complete
4. Once complete, your site will be live! ✨

### Step 5: Access Your Website

Your website will be available at:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/
```

For example:
- If username is `johnsmith` and repo is `sukheswari-birthday`
- URL: `https://johnsmith.github.io/sukheswari-birthday/`

---

## 🔄 Updating Your Website

After the initial deployment, every time you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site:

```bash
# Make your changes to the code

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update gallery photos"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

Wait 1-2 minutes and your changes will be live!

### ⚠️ Important: If You Rename Your Repository

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically uses your repository name as the base path. If you rename your repository:

1. Your site URL will change to: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/NEW-REPO-NAME/`
2. The workflow will automatically adjust - no code changes needed!
3. Update any bookmarks or shared links to the new URL

---

## 🌐 Using a Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use **sukheswari28.com** instead of the GitHub URL:

1. Purchase your domain from any registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.)
2. In GitHub repository **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**:
   - Enter: `sukheswari28.com` (or `www.sukheswari28.com`)
   - Click **Save**
3. In your domain registrar's DNS settings, add these records:

   **For apex domain (sukheswari28.com):**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 185.199.108.153
   
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 185.199.109.153
   
   Type: A  
   Name: @
   Value: 185.199.110.153
   
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 185.199.111.153
   ```

   **For www subdomain:**
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
   ```

4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
5. Your site will be accessible at your custom domain!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Build failed" in Actions
- Check the Actions logs for specific errors
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify the build runs locally: `npm run build`

### "404 Page Not Found" after deployment
- Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
- Check that the workflow completed successfully
- Wait a few more minutes (first deployment can take 5-10 minutes)

### Images/Assets not loading
- GitHub Pages URLs are case-sensitive
- Check that all image paths are correct
- Verify images are in the `attached_assets` folder

### Password not working
- Remember: password is "pinky" (lowercase works)
- It's stored in sessionStorage, so it resets when browser closes
- Client-side only - not secure against determined users

## 💰 Cost Comparison

### GitHub Pages (This Setup)

## 📞 Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Try building locally first: `npm run build`
3. Verify all files are committed and pushed
4. Wait a few minutes - deployments aren't instant

---

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, share your link:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/
```

Or with custom domain:
```
https://sukheswari28.com
```

Enjoy your free, fast, and reliable hosting! 💕
